## Requirements
1. Node
1. NPM
1. Babel
1. Gatsby

## Get Started
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
1. Run `gatsby develop` to start the local dev server
  - Error: it's highly likely you will run into dependency issues at some point
1. Visit `localhost:8000` in the browser

## Deploy
The Master branch auto-deploys to Netlify. The `build` cycle will run on deploy. If a major error occurs Netlify *will not* publish the code, which can be a life saver.

## Branches and Test Branches
Netlify offers the ability to test your work with branches.

1. Push a branch to Github
