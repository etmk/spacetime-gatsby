Hey Bart,

Awesome, and I completely understand the decision to hold off for the time being. After our conversation, I agree waiting is best. Part of why I like to have a good early conversation is for that exact reason. I would rather talk with a potential client and pause going forward than have a client spend thousands of dollars shooting at an unknown target. Feel free to reach out any time if you determine you need help with a project of any kind.

Also, would you mind if I quote you as I build this type of consulting package? Something like this:

"I found our meeting very useful. I was impressed with how quickly Caleb assessed my situation and was able to offer quick feedback and sound advice. He even convinced me not to spend thousands of dollars yet on the project because I needed to spend more time evaluating my desired outcome and needs for the project." ‚ÄìBart B.

A yes or no is totally fine, or if you wanted to put it into your own words. No pressure.

Thanks for the reply and encouraging word. Hope you're doing well, and I may need to connect you with a another guy I'm working with that just started going to Watermark Dallas. He is also in real estate.

Sorry to take so long to respond, as Im really glad we connected.

Right now I think I am going to hold off on making a website investment, until I can fully articulate

what I want and or need. I am still researching and fact finding, what I actually want out of a real estate website.

I have some websites that are not very optimal, but I also have not maximized what they

can do. I need to fully utilize and analyze what is working well, and what is not, before taking the leap to

a professional grade website, which I think you would be a great fit in helping me create.


To answer your question-- yes I found our meeting very useful. I was impressed with how quickly you assessed my situation,

 and were able to offer quick feedback and sound advice. With some further experience and resume of client testimonials,

I could definitely see this type of coaching/consulting in your future. There is certainly a market for this kind of work,

as most all businesses need websites, social media, digital marketing, and technology consulting.


Thanks again for meeting with me. Id love to reconnect later this year. 

      <p>Whether you are bootstraping or raising venture capital, building a startup is a challenge unlike other business types. At Spacetime, we've worked with a variety of startups and developed select categories of startup types that speak to the stage of your business and goal direction.</p>

      <p>We see 4 primary types of startups:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="" className="red f3 fw7">Concept Exploration ‚áõ</a>
          <p>You have a brand new idea or existing problem and need conceptual exploration and validation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="" className="red f3 fw7">Minimum Viable Product ‚áõ</a>
          <p>You are ready to build your startup and want to get to market quickly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="" className="red f3 fw7">Startup Resuscitation ‚áõ</a>
          <p>You've worked on a startup for months or years but have made little progress. It's a good idea, but needs a healthy shock to get going again.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="" className="red f3 fw7">Choose Your Own Adventure ‚áõ</a>
          <p>You have a specific challenge in mind you need help with.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Whatever your need, we always treat your project like our own. As the Spacetime team, we know we've succeeded when you succeed.</p>
      <p>Our specialized team will take you through our battle-hardened process</p>
