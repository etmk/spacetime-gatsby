          <p>Whether you are bootstraping or raising venture capital, building a startup is a challenge unlike other business types. At Spacetime, we've worked with a variety of startups and developed select service categories for startups that speak to the stage of your business and goal direction.</p>

          <p>We see 4 primary types of startup needs:</p>

          <p>Our concept exploration startup tier is perfect for exploring and validating ideas. We find clients typically need concept exploration for two types of challenges.</p>

          <h3 className="f3 mb1"><small className="mr2 f5 serif">I.</small>A Brand New Startup Idea</h3>

          <p className="mt1">If you have a brand new startup idea but have not validated the idea or audience this could be what you need. We use a series of research, design, prototyping, and user testing to explore a concept with a goal in mind. Sometimes that goal is to create a visual concept, or build a prototype to test on potential customers, or even in preparation to raise venture capital.</p>

            <p className="f6 sans-serif blue mb0">We worked with <strong>DropIn</strong> to design a concept the team could use to seek venture capital. We created visual branding and app interface flows to demonstrate the user experience and value proposition. We also developed a live app scaffold reflecting our findings in the design. The app wasn't full functioning, but provided real data and an MVP experience.</p>

          <p>If you have an existing startup but and want to explore a problem we can do that too. Maybe you want to explore a visual redesign of your app. Or, you need to explore why customers are dropping out of your eCommerce checkout cycle. Or, you want to pitch a skunk-works type idea to your internal leadership.</p>

          <p>The <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> is a common concept in the startup world. The term comes from Eric Reis' book <em>The Lean Startup</em> where Eric writes about his personal startup experience and subsequent consulting and advisory positions with startups.</p>

          <p>The purpose of an MVP is to take your concept or idea, whittle it down to the most essential and useful aspects, build it, and put it in front of customers as quickly as possible. So, to find our MVP we need to answer a few questions:</p>

          <ol className="system-sans o-70 lh-copy dark-purple f6 fw5 mv4">
            <li className="mv2">What is the most important core concept of the product?</li>

            <li className="mv2">How can we test our product hypothesis on our audience as quickly and cheaply as possible?</li>

Steadkey's founder, Jerry Williams, had begun Steadkey several years earlier, based on his extensive experience in the mortgage industry, but had little success. He'd worked with 3 independent developers and 2 professional agencies, yet 4 years later still did not have the solution promissed. The first thing we did with Jerry in January 2016 was strip away all the cruft and excess features and ideas muddying up the success of Steadkey. Starting from scratch, we executed on the key value propositions customers sought. We rebuilt the application from nothing, and in less than 3 months launched the new and improved Steadkey app and gained immediate traction with new customers. Consider that for a moment, 3 months versus the previous 4 years‚Ä¶ yeah, that's awesome.</p>

          <p>Startup resuscitation refers to revitalizing products that have lingered for months or years without traction. Sometimes that's because the startup began as a founder's side project, or product-market fit was never acheived, or maybe the technology behind the product is inherintly broken.</p>
          <p>Whatever the reason, if the concept is solid and an audience exists you can succeed.</p>
          <p>At Spacetime, we seem to attract distressed startups suffering from years of neglect, poor implementation, or lamentable previous agencies. We are different than other agencies in that we do not want to drag out your project as long as possible and squeeze as much money from you as we can. In fact, we will probably try to convince you to reduce the full scope of your project if possible.</p>
          <p>We will work with you to build a project plan and find traction:</p>

          <ol className="system-sans o-70 lh-copy dark-purple f6 fw5 mv3">
            <li className="mv2">Determine the startups value proposition</li>
            <li className="mv2">Determine the target audience</li>
            <li className="mv2">What are low effort, big wins to focus on</li>
            <li className="mv2">How can we gain initial traction</li>
            <li className="mv2">What needs to happen to turn the startup into a sustainable, scaleable business traction</li>

            <p className="f6 sans-serif blue mb0"><a className="blue hover-dark-blue b" href="https://www.studiohopfitness.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">StudioHop Fitness</a> is one of our best examples of Startup Resuscitation. When we partnered with StudioHop in December 2015, the company was doing okay, but being crushed by previously poor vendor directions and a crumbling technology stack. At that time StudioHop had around 150 monthly customers generating $15k MRR. Sounds like good numbers, right? Sort of. The mild success StudioHop had acheived was also killing them. The business was operating at a loss, customers were leaving, and the web application barely functioned and required a lot of manual intervention. There was no way the business could grow or handle more customers even if they could attract new customers.</p>
            <p className="f6 sans-serif blue mb0">The first thing Spacetime did was replatform the StudioHop application from a previous vendors "proprietary" PHP framework to Ruby on Rails (Note: ask a lot of questions if an agency recommends using their own "propriety" anything; usually they are trying to lock you into only working with them). Ruby on Rails offers great features and abilities to get a product up and running fast, for less cost than other tech options, and in this case StudioHop would be able to easily find and hire developers or vendors that know and love Ruby on Rails.</p>
