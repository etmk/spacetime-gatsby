          <h2>What could go wrong:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Giving the wrong people your money</li>
            <li>Not performing due diligence on agencies or new hires</li>

          <p>That's where we come in.</p>

          <p>We're right in-between a fellow co-founder and your best friend. And maybe a little bit of your momma.</p>

          <h3>We want you to:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Be responsible (your momma)</li>
            <li>Build a successful business (your co-founder)</li>
            <li>Be profitable (so you can pay for your best friends lunch, occasionally)</li>
