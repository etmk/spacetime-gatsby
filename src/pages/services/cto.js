          <p>You run a technology based business.</p>

          <p>You have the vision. You have the goal. You have the focus. Now all you have to do is build the software product, launch it, monetize it, scale it, avoid business killing mistakes, hire the right people, and responsibly spend your money and time.</p>

          <p>Simple right? Unfortunately, no&hellip;</p>

          <p>How will you tread the technological waters ahead, choose the right tech stack, hire the best employees and contractors, protect your business data and intellectual property, and in the end, win?</p>

          <p>You need a <abbr title="Chief Technology Officer">CTO</abbr> to lead the way.</p>

          <p>Making the right technology choices won't necessarily lead to success, but making the wrong choices <em>will kill you</em>. That's why you need an expert on your team to lead the way and help inform the technological decision of your business.</p>

          <p>If you are technical or have a technical co-founder, perfect, you're probably good to go. But if you don't, you should hire a CTO, well, sort&nbsp;of&hellip;</p>

          <p>You could hire a C-level executive to your team. But that brings a whole new set of challenges to your business, including a hefty salary. The median <a href="https://www1.salary.com/Chief-Technology-Officer-Salary.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CTO salary in the United States is $233,705</a>. Whew, that's a lot of dough to shell out for an early stage business. Money that you probably should spend elsewhere, like on programmers, services, and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Let's do some simple math comparisons:</p>
